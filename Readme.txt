Access lists by either /wp or clicking the icon.
Select Zone/Filter for what you are looking for

Eventually I would like to incorporate some clicking or something to change the completed status or automatically set the waypoints... but that would mean I would have to learn Lua some more.. or just spend more than an afternoon trying to piece it together..

Layout based off of Xenyr's Completionist Addon and modified to suit the changes..
